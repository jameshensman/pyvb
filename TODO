[TODO]
Docstrings in the Numpy style.

Documentation generally.

Finish the multiplication node to cope with hstacked matrices

Implement the hstack class

Make the tests into a proper tests module and examples module

Sampling from the (variational) posterior - this will involve crawling the network, which means that nodes will need pointers to their parents.

Calculation of the Lower bound

Gaussian Process Prior nodes.

Partially observed nodes (i.e. handle missing data gracefully)


[DONE]
Implement (or think about) a constant class, to allow for __rmul__
Renaming of the messages (currently pass_up_ex, pass_up_prec, which is a little misleading...) [Changed to m1, m2. Also in doc.]
